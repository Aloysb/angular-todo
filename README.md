# AngularTodo

Yes, I hear you, yet another TODO...

But hey, what better than a good old todo to get your feet wet in a new framework/language?

Also, it's getting late and I just want to enjoy my evening 🌄

I have avoided Angular for a long time, whilst having tried every other major and minor framework out there.

Which is quite interesting, since I do tend to appreciate opiniated tools...

The time has come, Angular, here I come. Let's see if can make this together 🍻
