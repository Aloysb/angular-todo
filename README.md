# AngularTodo

Yes, I hear you, yet another TODO...
But hey, what better than a good old todo to get your feet wet in a new framework/language?
Also, it's getting late and I just want to enjoy my evening üåÑ üç∫

I have avoided Angular for a long time, whilst having tried every other major and minor framework out there.
Which is quite interesting, since I do tend to appreciate opiniated tools...
The time has come, Angular, here I come. Let's see if can make this together üçª


## API / Backend

We're simply using the [json.placeholder] as a backend (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos).
That's enough for what we're doing here.

In terms of schema, we're going to use whatever is provided by the jsonplaceholder directly.
We're focusing on Angular here guys!

## Testing

A complete introduction to a new framework wouldn't be complete with a bit of testing.
I'm using a BDD-ish way of working here, with cypress as and e2e and whatever-come-with-angular (Karma?) for the TDD part.

There are no acceptance test as such, I'm just going to aim for high level e2e tests and then zoom in to TDD my way in there.

Coming from React, there's no way around Jest + React Testing Library, two absolutely great tools.
I'm quite familiar with Cypress - also I don't really do any e2e testing in my current role - I'm more focused on a integration/unit level.

I'm curious to see how Karma behave.
